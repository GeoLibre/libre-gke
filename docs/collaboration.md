# Collaboration
Sharing and collaboration are important for knowledge to thrive. In order for people to collaborate, they need to share a common project with the ability to see a common view of knowledge at any given time. Collaborators may also approach the project from different perspectives, so they can blend their experience and work independently where needed.
