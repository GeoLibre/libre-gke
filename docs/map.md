# Map UI
The Map UI component is central to the design of the Geographic Knowledge Explorer. It should display in the middle of the screen, with other components hiding around the edges. The map should have the following features:

* Select base layer from open data sources
* Give attribution to base layer
* Optionally display a small layer visibility toggle, hidden initially

## Interaction
* Touch and drag to pan
* Pinch or scroll to zoom in or out
